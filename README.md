This repository contains all files related to the project "Structural Decomposition Meets Topological Data Analysis: Exploring Syntax and Emotion in Sentence Embeddings" by Sindhu Kothe. The study investigates how emotional content—modeled through both discrete emotion categories and continuous VAD scores—affects the topological structure of sentence embeddings using tools like Kepler Mapper, UMAP, and persistent homology.

The goal of this project is to understand how emotion influences the geometry and topology of language embeddings. Specifically, it analyzes:

  How categorical emotions (e.g., anger, joy, fear) shape topological structure.
  How Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) scores influence sentence embedding geometry.
  How topological features such as clustering, connectivity, loops, and dispersion reflect emotional properties of text.
