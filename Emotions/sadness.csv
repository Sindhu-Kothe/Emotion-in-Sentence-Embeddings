Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,negative

"Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together.",negative
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?,negative
"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",negative
"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",negative
"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",negative
"So, I guess this is over.",negative
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",negative
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",negative
"Oh God, I’m so sorry.",negative

No more Joey and Chan’s.,negative
No more J and C’s.,negative
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,negative
Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.,negative
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,negative
"Oh, come on!",negative
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",negative
"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",negative
"Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy.",negative
"I mean, I remember a time when",negative
"Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine!",negative
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,negative
"And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",negative
I can't believe you would say that!,negative
Will the stable boy never get the princess??,negative
"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?",negative
I didn't think I could ever love again.,negative
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",negative
Why?,negative
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well, that’s not the worst part.",negative
I can’t remember which sister.,negative
"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since.",negative
Can we please turn this off?,negative
I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.,negative
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.,negative
Try telling my wife that.,negative
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,negative
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,negative
"Okay, I’m sorry.",negative
I didn’t mean to scare you.,negative
I broke it.,negative
"Leslie, now would be a",negative
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",negative
"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",negative
"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",negative
Well it’s very unsettling.,negative
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",negative
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?",negative
Yeah.,negative
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,negative
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",negative
Really stupid.,negative
And I don't even know how it happened.,negative
"I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.",negative
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",negative
"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you.",negative
"Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",negative
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",negative
"Ohh, I’m sorry.",negative
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",negative
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",negative
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,negative
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",negative
"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",negative
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",negative
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",negative
Sorry.,negative
I’m sorry Joey.,negative
"Well, people!",negative
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.,negative
"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",negative
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",negative
"He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",negative
"Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",negative
"I'm sorry, man.",negative
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",negative
"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?",negative
I can't do it.,negative
"All right, I…I have to ask.",negative
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",negative
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",negative
I’m sorry.,negative
Ohhh. Don’t go.,negative
"No, I-I-I gotta go.",negative
No. No! No! No!,negative
"Honey, honey, people are looking.",negative
"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.",negative
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!,negative
Good-bye Chandler Bing.,negative
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",negative
No. A break from us.,negative
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,negative
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",negative
No. Sorry.,negative
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,negative
And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,negative
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!,negative
"I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",negative
Come on!,negative
It’s like the end of an era!,negative
No more J-man and Channie’s!,negative
Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,negative
Hey!,negative
"Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there.",negative
I can’t believe we’re living here!,negative
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,negative
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",negative
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.",negative
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",negative
I didn’t make it!,negative
I’m sorry!,negative
"No-no, it’s not okay!",negative
It’s not!,negative
I mean you were just… You’re so incredible!,negative
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!,negative
I will!,negative
Hi! It’s me.,negative
"Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",negative
"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",negative
"Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",negative
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",negative
Oo God!,negative
"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages!",negative
I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby,negative
"Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",negative
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",negative
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",negative
"Well, I don't know what else to do.",negative
"Oh, how did it go?",negative
"Well uh, his answering machine was",negative
"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",negative
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care.",negative
I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about.,negative
"Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",negative
"Yeah, maybe.",negative
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,negative
Any luck?,negative
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",negative
"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",negative
Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.,negative
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",negative
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",negative
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",negative
What is it? Hey!,negative
Really it’s nothing. I’m just,negative
I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,negative
"Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",negative
"I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",negative
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,negative
Every moment is precious.,negative
"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",negative
"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",negative
": I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.",negative
"Come on Treeger, don’t say that.",negative
"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",negative
You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.,negative
I-I do though.,negative
I do too.,negative
"Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",negative
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",negative
"Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.",negative
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",negative
Of course not.,negative
"Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",negative
So I don’t think I should do it anymore.,negative
I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.,negative
"Gunther, I quit.",negative
Hi!,negative
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here",negative
"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",negative
"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",negative
"Oh, my baby!",negative
Can I get some ice here?!,negative
"Oh uh, one of the writers.",negative
"I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",negative
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?,negative
"Yeah, I know.",negative
"I mean, no, you’re right.",negative
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,negative
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.",negative
"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",negative
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,negative
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",negative
I'm gonna have to give him up.,negative
"So, does that mean the audition is off?",negative
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",negative
What’s the matter?,negative
"I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",negative
"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",negative
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",negative
"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",negative
"Oh, how bad is it?",negative
"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do",negative
Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,negative

"Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together.",negative
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?,negative
"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",negative
"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",negative
"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",negative
"So, I guess this is over.",negative
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",negative
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",negative
"Oh God, I’m so sorry.",negative
Sure! I feel so bad for you. I broke my leg once too.,negative
Car accident.,negative
"Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.",negative
The three losers.,negative
"Oh, poor Lily.",negative
"Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.",negative
"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!",negative
Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.,negative
"Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won’t stop crying.",negative
"Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right.",negative
"We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why?",negative
"Yeah, I lost it.",negative
"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here.",negative
No more Joey and Chan’s.,negative
No more J and C’s.,negative
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,negative
Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.,negative
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,negative
"Oh, come on!",negative
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",negative
"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",negative
"Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy.",negative
"I mean, I remember a time when",negative
"Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine!",negative
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,negative
"And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",negative
I can't believe you would say that!,negative
Will the stable boy never get the princess??,negative
"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?",negative
I didn't think I could ever love again.,negative
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",negative
Why?,negative
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well, that’s not the worst part.",negative
I can’t remember which sister.,negative
"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since.",negative
Can we please turn this off?,negative
I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.,negative
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.,negative
Try telling my wife that.,negative
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,negative
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,negative
"Okay, I’m sorry.",negative
I didn’t mean to scare you.,negative
I broke it.,negative
"Leslie, now would be a",negative
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",negative
"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",negative
"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",negative
Well it’s very unsettling.,negative
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",negative
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?",negative
Yeah.,negative
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,negative
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",negative
Really stupid.,negative
And I don't even know how it happened.,negative
"I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.",negative
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",negative
"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you.",negative
"Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",negative
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",negative
"Ohh, I’m sorry.",negative
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",negative
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",negative
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,negative
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",negative
"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",negative
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",negative
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",negative
Sorry.,negative
I’m sorry Joey.,negative
"Well, people!",negative
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.,negative
"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",negative
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",negative
"He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",negative
"Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",negative
"I'm sorry, man.",negative
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",negative
"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?",negative
I can't do it.,negative
"All right, I…I have to ask.",negative
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",negative
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",negative
I’m sorry.,negative
Ohhh. Don’t go.,negative
"No, I-I-I gotta go.",negative
No. No! No! No!,negative
"Honey, honey, people are looking.",negative
"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.",negative
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!,negative
Good-bye Chandler Bing.,negative
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",negative
No. A break from us.,negative
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,negative
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",negative
No. Sorry.,negative
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,negative
And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,negative
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!,negative
"I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",negative
Come on!,negative
It’s like the end of an era!,negative
No more J-man and Channie’s!,negative
Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,negative
Hey!,negative
"Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there.",negative
I can’t believe we’re living here!,negative
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,negative
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",negative
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.",negative
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",negative
I didn’t make it!,negative
I’m sorry!,negative
"No-no, it’s not okay!",negative
It’s not!,negative
I mean you were just… You’re so incredible!,negative
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!,negative
I will!,negative
Hi! It’s me.,negative
"Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",negative
"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",negative
"Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",negative
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",negative
Oo God!,negative
"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages!",negative
I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby,negative
"Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",negative
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",negative
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",negative
"Well, I don't know what else to do.",negative
"Oh, how did it go?",negative
"Well uh, his answering machine was",negative
"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",negative
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care.",negative
I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about.,negative
"Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",negative
"Yeah, maybe.",negative
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,negative
Any luck?,negative
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",negative
"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",negative
Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.,negative
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",negative
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",negative
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",negative
What is it? Hey!,negative
Really it’s nothing. I’m just,negative
I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,negative
"Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",negative
"I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",negative
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,negative
Every moment is precious.,negative
"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",negative
"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",negative
": I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.",negative
"Come on Treeger, don’t say that.",negative
"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",negative
You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.,negative
I-I do though.,negative
I do too.,negative
"Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",negative
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",negative
"Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.",negative
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",negative
Of course not.,negative
"Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",negative
So I don’t think I should do it anymore.,negative
I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.,negative
"Gunther, I quit.",negative
Hi!,negative
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here",negative
"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",negative
"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",negative
"Oh, my baby!",negative
Can I get some ice here?!,negative
"Oh uh, one of the writers.",negative
"I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",negative
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?,negative
"Yeah, I know.",negative
"I mean, no, you’re right.",negative
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,negative
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.",negative
"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",negative
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,negative
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",negative
I'm gonna have to give him up.,negative
"So, does that mean the audition is off?",negative
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",negative
What’s the matter?,negative
"I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",negative
"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",negative
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",negative
"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",negative
"Oh, how bad is it?",negative
"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do",negative
Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,negative
"Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!",negative
"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.",negative
"Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together.",negative

"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",negative
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",negative
"Oh God, I’m so sorry.",negative
Sure! I feel so bad for you. I broke my leg once too.,negative
Car accident.,negative
"Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.",negative
The three losers.,negative
"Oh, poor Lily.",negative
"Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.",negative
"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!",negative
Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.,negative
"Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won’t stop crying.",negative
"Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right.",negative
"We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why?",negative
"Yeah, I lost it.",negative
"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here.",negative
No more Joey and Chan’s.,negative
No more J and C’s.,negative
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,negative
Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.,negative
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,negative
"Oh, come on!",negative
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",negative
"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",negative
"Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy.",negative
"I mean, I remember a time when",negative
"Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine!",negative
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,negative
"And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",negative
I can't believe you would say that!,negative
Will the stable boy never get the princess??,negative
"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?",negative
I didn't think I could ever love again.,negative
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",negative
Why?,negative
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well, that’s not the worst part.",negative
I can’t remember which sister.,negative
"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since.",negative
Can we please turn this off?,negative
I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.,negative
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.,negative
Try telling my wife that.,negative
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,negative
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,negative
"Okay, I’m sorry.",negative
I didn’t mean to scare you.,negative
I broke it.,negative
"Leslie, now would be a",negative
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",negative
"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",negative
"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",negative
Well it’s very unsettling.,negative
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",negative
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?",negative
Yeah.,negative
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,negative
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",negative
Really stupid.,negative
And I don't even know how it happened.,negative
"I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.",negative
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",negative
"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you.",negative
"Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",negative
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",negative
"Ohh, I’m sorry.",negative
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",negative
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",negative
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,negative
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",negative
"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",negative
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",negative
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",negative
Sorry.,negative
I’m sorry Joey.,negative
"Well, people!",negative
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.,negative
"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",negative
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",negative
"He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",negative
"Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",negative
"I'm sorry, man.",negative
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",negative
"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?",negative
I can't do it.,negative
"All right, I…I have to ask.",negative
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",negative
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",negative
I’m sorry.,negative
Ohhh. Don’t go.,negative
"No, I-I-I gotta go.",negative
No. No! No! No!,negative
"Honey, honey, people are looking.",negative
"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.",negative
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!,negative
Good-bye Chandler Bing.,negative
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",negative
No. A break from us.,negative
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,negative
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",negative
No. Sorry.,negative
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,negative
And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,negative
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!,negative
"I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",negative
Come on!,negative
It’s like the end of an era!,negative
No more J-man and Channie’s!,negative
Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,negative
Hey!,negative
"Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there.",negative
I can’t believe we’re living here!,negative
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,negative
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",negative
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.",negative
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",negative
I didn’t make it!,negative
I’m sorry!,negative
"No-no, it’s not okay!",negative
It’s not!,negative
I mean you were just… You’re so incredible!,negative
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!,negative
I will!,negative
Hi! It’s me.,negative
"Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",negative
"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",negative
"Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",negative
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",negative
Oo God!,negative
"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages!",negative
I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby,negative
"Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",negative
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",negative
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",negative
"Well, I don't know what else to do.",negative
"Oh, how did it go?",negative
"Well uh, his answering machine was",negative
"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",negative
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care.",negative
I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about.,negative
"Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",negative
"Yeah, maybe.",negative
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,negative
Any luck?,negative
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",negative
"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",negative
Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.,negative
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",negative
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",negative
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",negative
What is it? Hey!,negative
Really it’s nothing. I’m just,negative
I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,negative
"Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",negative
"I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",negative
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,negative
Every moment is precious.,negative
"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",negative
"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",negative
": I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.",negative
"Come on Treeger, don’t say that.",negative
"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",negative
You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.,negative
I-I do though.,negative
I do too.,negative
"Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",negative
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",negative
"Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.",negative
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",negative
Of course not.,negative
"Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",negative
So I don’t think I should do it anymore.,negative
I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.,negative
"Gunther, I quit.",negative
Hi!,negative
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here",negative
"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",negative
"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",negative
"Oh, my baby!",negative
Can I get some ice here?!,negative
"Oh uh, one of the writers.",negative
"I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",negative
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?,negative
"Yeah, I know.",negative
"I mean, no, you’re right.",negative
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,negative
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.",negative
"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",negative
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,negative
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",negative
I'm gonna have to give him up.,negative
"So, does that mean the audition is off?",negative
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",negative
What’s the matter?,negative
"I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",negative
"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",negative
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",negative
"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",negative
"Oh, how bad is it?",negative
"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do",negative
Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,negative
"Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!",negative
"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.",negative
"Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together.",negative
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?,negative
"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",negative
"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",negative
"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",negative
"So, I guess this is over.",negative
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",negative

"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!",negative
Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.,negative
"Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won’t stop crying.",negative
"Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right.",negative
"We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why?",negative
"Yeah, I lost it.",negative
"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here.",negative
No more Joey and Chan’s.,negative
No more J and C’s.,negative
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,negative
Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.,negative
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,negative
"Oh, come on!",negative
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",negative
"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",negative
"Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy.",negative
"I mean, I remember a time when",negative
"Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine!",negative
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,negative
"And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",negative
I can't believe you would say that!,negative
Will the stable boy never get the princess??,negative
"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?",negative
I didn't think I could ever love again.,negative
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",negative
Why?,negative
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well, that’s not the worst part.",negative
I can’t remember which sister.,negative
"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since.",negative
Can we please turn this off?,negative
I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.,negative
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.,negative
Try telling my wife that.,negative
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,negative
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,negative
"Okay, I’m sorry.",negative
I didn’t mean to scare you.,negative
I broke it.,negative
"Leslie, now would be a",negative
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",negative
"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",negative
"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",negative
Well it’s very unsettling.,negative
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",negative
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?",negative
Yeah.,negative
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,negative
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",negative
Really stupid.,negative
And I don't even know how it happened.,negative
"I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.",negative
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",negative
"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you.",negative
"Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",negative
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",negative
"Ohh, I’m sorry.",negative
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",negative
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",negative
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,negative
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",negative
"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",negative
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",negative
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",negative
Sorry.,negative
I’m sorry Joey.,negative
"Well, people!",negative
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.,negative
"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",negative
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",negative
"He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",negative
"Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",negative
"I'm sorry, man.",negative
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",negative
"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?",negative
I can't do it.,negative
"All right, I…I have to ask.",negative
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",negative
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",negative
I’m sorry.,negative
Ohhh. Don’t go.,negative
"No, I-I-I gotta go.",negative
No. No! No! No!,negative
"Honey, honey, people are looking.",negative
"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.",negative
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!,negative
Good-bye Chandler Bing.,negative
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",negative
No. A break from us.,negative
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,negative
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",negative
No. Sorry.,negative
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,negative
And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,negative
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!,negative
"I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",negative
Come on!,negative
It’s like the end of an era!,negative
No more J-man and Channie’s!,negative
Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,negative
Hey!,negative
"Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there.",negative
I can’t believe we’re living here!,negative
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,negative
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",negative
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.",negative
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",negative
I didn’t make it!,negative
I’m sorry!,negative
"No-no, it’s not okay!",negative
It’s not!,negative
I mean you were just… You’re so incredible!,negative
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!,negative
I will!,negative
Hi! It’s me.,negative
"Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",negative
"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",negative
"Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",negative
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",negative
Oo God!,negative
"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages!",negative
I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby,negative
"Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",negative
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",negative
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",negative
"Well, I don't know what else to do.",negative
"Oh, how did it go?",negative
"Well uh, his answering machine was",negative
"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",negative
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care.",negative
I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about.,negative
"Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",negative
"Yeah, maybe.",negative
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,negative
Any luck?,negative
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",negative
"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",negative
Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.,negative
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",negative
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",negative
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",negative
What is it? Hey!,negative
Really it’s nothing. I’m just,negative
I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,negative
"Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",negative
"I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",negative
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,negative
Every moment is precious.,negative
"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",negative
"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",negative
": I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.",negative
"Come on Treeger, don’t say that.",negative
"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",negative
You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.,negative
I-I do though.,negative
I do too.,negative
"Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",negative
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",negative
"Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.",negative
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",negative
Of course not.,negative
"Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",negative
So I don’t think I should do it anymore.,negative
I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.,negative
"Gunther, I quit.",negative
Hi!,negative
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here",negative
"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",negative
"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",negative
"Oh, my baby!",negative
Can I get some ice here?!,negative
"Oh uh, one of the writers.",negative
"I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",negative
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?,negative
"Yeah, I know.",negative
"I mean, no, you’re right.",negative
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,negative
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.",negative
"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",negative
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,negative
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",negative
I'm gonna have to give him up.,negative
"So, does that mean the audition is off?",negative
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",negative
What’s the matter?,negative
"I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",negative
"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",negative
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",negative
"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",negative
"Oh, how bad is it?",negative
"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do",negative
Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.,negative
"Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!",negative
"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.",negative
"Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together.",negative
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?,negative
"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",negative
"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",negative
"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",negative
"So, I guess this is over.",negative
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",negative
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",negative
"Oh God, I’m so sorry.",negative
Sure! I feel so bad for you. I broke my leg once too.,negative
Car accident.,negative
"Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.",negative
The three losers.,negative
"Oh, poor Lily.",negative
"Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.",negative
"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!",negative

Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,negative
Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.,negative
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,negative
"Oh, come on!",negative
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",negative
"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",negative
"Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy.",negative
"I mean, I remember a time when",negative
"Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine!",negative
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,negative
"And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",negative
I can't believe you would say that!,negative
Will the stable boy never get the princess??,negative
"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?",negative
I didn't think I could ever love again.,negative
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",negative
Why?,negative
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well, that’s not the worst part.",negative
I can’t remember which sister.,negative
"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since.",negative
Can we please turn this off?,negative
I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.,negative
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.,negative
Try telling my wife that.,negative
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!,negative
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,negative
"Okay, I’m sorry.",negative
I didn’t mean to scare you.,negative
I broke it.,negative
"Leslie, now would be a",negative
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",negative
"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",negative
"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",negative
Well it’s very unsettling.,negative
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",negative
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?",negative
Yeah.,negative
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.,negative
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",negative
Really stupid.,negative
And I don't even know how it happened.,negative
"I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.",negative
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",negative
"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you.",negative
"Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",negative
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",negative
"Ohh, I’m sorry.",negative
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",negative
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",negative
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,negative
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",negative
"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",negative
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",negative
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",negative
Sorry.,negative
I’m sorry Joey.,negative
"Well, people!",negative
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.,negative
"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",negative
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",negative
"He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",negative
"Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",negative
"I'm sorry, man.",negative
"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",negative
"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?",negative
I can't do it.,negative
"All right, I…I have to ask.",negative
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",negative
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",negative
I’m sorry.,negative
Ohhh. Don’t go.,negative
"No, I-I-I gotta go.",negative
No. No! No! No!,negative
"Honey, honey, people are looking.",negative
"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.",negative
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!,negative
Good-bye Chandler Bing.,negative
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",negative
No. A break from us.,negative
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,negative
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",negative
No. Sorry.,negative
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,negative
And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,negative
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!,negative
"I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",negative
Come on!,negative
It’s like the end of an era!,negative
No more J-man and Channie’s!,negative
Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,negative
Hey!,negative
"Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there.",negative
I can’t believe we’re living here!,negative
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,negative
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.",negative
"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.",negative
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",negative
I didn’t make it!,negative
I’m sorry!,negative
"No-no, it’s not okay!",negative
It’s not!,negative
I mean you were just… You’re so incredible!,negative
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!,negative
I will!,negative
Hi! It’s me.,negative
"Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",negative
"Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",negative
"Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",negative
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",negative
Oo God!,negative
"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages!",negative
I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby,negative
"Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",negative
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",negative
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",negative
"Well, I don't know what else to do.",negative
"Oh, how did it go?",negative
"Well uh, his answering machine was",negative
"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",negative
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care.",negative
I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about.,negative
"Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",negative
"Yeah, maybe.",negative
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,negative
Any luck?,negative
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",negative
"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",negative
Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.,negative
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",negative
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",negative
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",negative
What is it? Hey!,negative
Really it’s nothing. I’m just,negative
I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,negative
"Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",negative
"I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",negative
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,negative
Every moment is precious.,negative
"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",negative
"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",negative
": I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.",negative
"Come on Treeger, don’t say that.",negative
"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",negative
You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.,negative
I-I do though.,negative
I do too.,negative
"Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",negative
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",negative
"Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.",negative
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",negative
Of course not.,negative
"Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",negative
So I don’t think I should do it anymore.,negative
I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.,negative
"Gunther, I quit.",negative
Hi!,negative
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here",negative
"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",negative
"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",negative
"Oh, my baby!",negative
Can I get some ice here?!,negative
"Oh uh, one of the writers.",negative
"I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",negative
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?,negative
"Yeah, I know.",negative
"I mean, no, you’re right.",negative
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.,negative
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.",negative
"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",negative
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,negative
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",negative
I'm gonna have to give him up.,negative
"So, does that mean the audition is off?",negative
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",negative
What’s the matter?,negative
"I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",negative
