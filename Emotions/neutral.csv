"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral

Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral

What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral

"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral

There's a forest right outside.,neutral

Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral

"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral

I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral

Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral

Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral

"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral

You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral

"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral

"Well, if you want, you can work here.",neutral
"Uh, I don’t know.",neutral
"Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know?",neutral
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",neutral
Flexible hours.,neutral

Who's he sleeping with?,neutral
"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...",neutral
"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.",neutral
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",neutral
So where did you study?,neutral
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",neutral
"No, where did you study acting?",neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,neutral
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",neutral

We just want you to think it through.,neutral
"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?",neutral

"I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it.",neutral
"Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",neutral
How ya feelin’?,neutral
"Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",neutral
Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",neutral
What is the worse part?,neutral
"But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",neutral
It’s a trifle.,neutral
It’s got all of these layers.,neutral
"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral

"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",neutral
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.,neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,neutral

"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",neutral
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",neutral

"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",neutral
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral

"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral

"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral
I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral
Which is why,neutral
"No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.",neutral
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",neutral

But it’s absolutely your decision.,neutral
More tea?,neutral

"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.",neutral
"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral
What?,neutral
Frannie was the one who found your,neutral
"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",neutral
I believe you know my husband.,neutral
So it’s really a question of,neutral
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?,neutral
"Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",neutral
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,neutral

"Man to uh, me.",neutral
Sure. Okay.,neutral
"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.",neutral

One more game?,neutral
Rachel has those in burgendy.,neutral
What?,neutral
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.,neutral

"What, wait, you mean like this?",neutral
Your not doing it.,neutral
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment.,neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,neutral
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",neutral
"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,neutral

"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",neutral
Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,neutral
Oh? Why not?,neutral
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,neutral
So why can’t the three of us go out together?,neutral
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.",neutral
"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",neutral
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",neutral
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",neutral

"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.",neutral
"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.",neutral
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.,neutral
Did he call?,neutral
"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",neutral
"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",neutral
Do I know why we’re rushing?,neutral
"Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?",neutral

You forget how many great songs Heart had.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",neutral
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",neutral
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.,neutral

"Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?",neutral
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.,neutral
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",neutral
Would ya care to venture one?,neutral
Would,neutral
"All right, let's move on.",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.",neutral
"And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she?",neutral
"Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.",neutral

"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral

"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",neutral
Can I help you?,neutral
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",neutral
He’s not here right now.,neutral
"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",neutral
Okay?,neutral

"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral

"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral

Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral

Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral

"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral

"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral

"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral

"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral

"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral

Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral

"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral

"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral

"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
You’re welcome.,neutral
Gin.,neutral
Okay. All right.,neutral
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?",neutral
Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral

"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral

"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral

"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral

"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",neutral
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",neutral
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral

"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral
"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral
I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral
Which is why,neutral

"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",neutral

"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral

"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral

"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral

"Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?",neutral
"I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.",neutral
"No, she doesn’t.",neutral
"Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits.",neutral
I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to,neutral
"Oh, it’s okay. I don’t",neutral
I-I am going to,neutral
"Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.",neutral
"No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",neutral
"Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.",neutral
"Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",neutral
Hello.,neutral
"Hey, what do you want to drink?",neutral
Nobody.,neutral
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?,neutral
Is that Mark?,neutral
"Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",neutral
"Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.",neutral
"Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.",neutral
"Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.",neutral
You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.,neutral
Sure.,neutral
What contracts?,neutral
Like what?,neutral
"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.",neutral
You wanna go down to the office right now?,neutral
Okay I understand.  I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.,neutral
"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.",neutral
Nice to meet you.,neutral
Oh and I need to talk to you.,neutral
About what?,neutral
To see if know what these guys are talking about.,neutral
"Pheebs, how’s it going?",neutral

"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?",neutral
"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
...I dunno.,neutral
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,neutral
"Hey, Phoebe.",neutral
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",neutral
Can I help you?,neutral
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",neutral
He’s not here right now.,neutral
"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
I’m an actor. I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.,neutral
"Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.",neutral
"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral
"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",neutral
Yes.,neutral
I guess.,neutral
"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",neutral
"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral
-Peaches?,neutral
"Actually, nectarines, but basically...",neutral
Could've been a peach.,neutral
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral
Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like,neutral
"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral
Someone in there?,neutral
"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.",neutral
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",neutral
Ginger.,neutral
"Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",neutral
Don’t you have to use the bathroom?,neutral
"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral
You're definitely scaring here.,neutral
Would you like to call somebody?,neutral
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.",neutral
Oh,neutral
It’s my sister.,neutral
"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the",neutral
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a",neutral
"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",neutral
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral

Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey!,neutral

"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",neutral
"Well, if you want, you can work here.",neutral
"Uh, I don’t know.",neutral
"Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know?",neutral
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",neutral
Flexible hours.,neutral
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,neutral
I have no name.,neutral
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",neutral
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",neutral
"Umm, Gene.",neutral

"Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",neutral
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
They did it right there on the couch.,neutral
Who's he sleeping with?,neutral
"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...",neutral
"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.",neutral
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",neutral
So where did you study?,neutral
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",neutral
"No, where did you study acting?",neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,neutral
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",neutral
"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",neutral
Thanx.,neutral
"Hi, is Molly here?",neutral
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",neutral
"Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.",neutral
"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Not a problem.,neutral

"Okay, well then bring her in.",neutral
They don’t look any bigger than me!,neutral
I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?,neutral
All right.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,neutral
"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.",neutral
We just want you to think it through.,neutral
"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?",neutral
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.,neutral
"Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",neutral
Thank you. All right.,neutral
"Come, sit.",neutral
Sit.,neutral
"Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",neutral
Lucky sixes....,neutral
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",neutral

"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",neutral
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",neutral
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",neutral
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,neutral
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",neutral
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",neutral
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",neutral

"All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",neutral
"All right, all right, all right.",neutral
"I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it.",neutral
"Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",neutral
How ya feelin’?,neutral
"Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",neutral
Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",neutral
What is the worse part?,neutral
"But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",neutral
It’s a trifle.,neutral
It’s got all of these layers.,neutral
"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral
"then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",neutral
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?,neutral
"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",neutral
"Folks, has this ever happened to you.",neutral
"You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.",neutral
And there is Kevin.,neutral
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.,neutral
"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.",neutral
Go ahead.,neutral
This works with any milk carton.,neutral
"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.",neutral
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",neutral
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.,neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,neutral
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,neutral
"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",neutral

And I too am just a love machine.,neutral
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.",neutral
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",neutral
Y'know?,neutral

"Oh hey, Ross.",neutral
Something to think about.,neutral

"Oh, um, Chandler?",neutral
"Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.",neutral
"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",neutral
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",neutral
Do you have a dressing room?,neutral
Do you have a chair with your name on it?,neutral
"Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.",neutral
"Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!",neutral

Leslie?,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oh, there’s banana on it.",neutral
"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",neutral
"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",neutral
"Why, does she have a bad personality?",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oooh, wrong answer.",neutral
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.,neutral
"Honey, I was wondering....",neutral
Hmm?,neutral
Hmm.,neutral
"Well honey, what about you?",neutral
What?,neutral
"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",neutral
No.,neutral
That's OK.,neutral
We can't do that.,neutral
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...",neutral
"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",neutral
"Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",neutral
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",neutral
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",neutral
"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",neutral
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral
That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,neutral
A new grocery store.,neutral
"Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",neutral
"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",neutral
"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",neutral
"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral
"All right, let me in.",neutral
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",neutral
All right.,neutral
"Baking it didn't help, huh?",neutral
"All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",neutral
"Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me?",neutral
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",neutral
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",neutral
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral
She's not much of a phone person.,neutral
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",neutral
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",neutral
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,neutral
"Oh, that is so not true.",neutral
"Oh, it is.",neutral
It isn't.,neutral
It is.,neutral
"Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there.",neutral
Thanks.,neutral
"Yeah, yeah, I was watching.",neutral
"Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.",neutral

Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,neutral
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.",neutral
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later.",neutral
"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on",neutral
They’re all Chandler.,neutral
I did.  But it came at a price.,neutral
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral

"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral

"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",neutral

"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment.,neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,neutral
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",neutral
"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,neutral

It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,neutral
So why can’t the three of us go out together?,neutral
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.",neutral
"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",neutral
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",neutral
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",neutral

"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",neutral
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",neutral
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral

What do you think? You in the blue shirt.,neutral
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",neutral
Would ya care to venture one?,neutral

"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral

"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral

"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral

"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral

"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral

"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral

What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral

"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral

"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral

You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral

"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral

I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral

"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral
Someone in there?,neutral
"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.",neutral
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",neutral

"Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",neutral
Don’t you have to use the bathroom?,neutral
"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral
You're definitely scaring here.,neutral
Would you like to call somebody?,neutral
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.",neutral

"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the",neutral
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a",neutral
"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",neutral
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
You’re welcome.,neutral
Gin.,neutral
Okay. All right.,neutral
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?",neutral
Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey!,neutral

"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral

A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral

"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral

"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral

"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral

"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral

"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral

I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to,neutral
"Oh, it’s okay. I don’t",neutral
I-I am going to,neutral
"Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.",neutral
"No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",neutral
"Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.",neutral
"Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",neutral
Hello.,neutral
"Hey, what do you want to drink?",neutral
Nobody.,neutral
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?,neutral
Is that Mark?,neutral
"Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",neutral
"Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.",neutral
"Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.",neutral
"Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.",neutral
You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.,neutral
Sure.,neutral
What contracts?,neutral
Like what?,neutral
"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.",neutral
You wanna go down to the office right now?,neutral
Okay I understand.  I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.,neutral
"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.",neutral
Nice to meet you.,neutral
Oh and I need to talk to you.,neutral
About what?,neutral
To see if know what these guys are talking about.,neutral
"Pheebs, how’s it going?",neutral

"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?",neutral
"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
...I dunno.,neutral
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,neutral
"Hey, Phoebe.",neutral
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",neutral
Can I help you?,neutral
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",neutral
He’s not here right now.,neutral
"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
I’m an actor. I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.,neutral
"Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.",neutral
"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral
"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",neutral
Yes.,neutral
I guess.,neutral
"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",neutral
"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral
-Peaches?,neutral
"Actually, nectarines, but basically...",neutral
Could've been a peach.,neutral
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral
Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like,neutral
"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral
Someone in there?,neutral
"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.",neutral
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",neutral
Ginger.,neutral
"Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",neutral
Don’t you have to use the bathroom?,neutral
"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral
You're definitely scaring here.,neutral
Would you like to call somebody?,neutral
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.",neutral
Oh,neutral
It’s my sister.,neutral
"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the",neutral
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a",neutral
"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",neutral
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
You’re welcome.,neutral

Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",neutral
"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",neutral
"Well, if you want, you can work here.",neutral
"Uh, I don’t know.",neutral
"Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know?",neutral
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",neutral
Flexible hours.,neutral
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,neutral
I have no name.,neutral
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",neutral
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",neutral
"Umm, Gene.",neutral

"Bye, Gene.",neutral
Welcome to Las Vegas.,neutral
Hope you had a nice flight.,neutral
"Oh, Larry.",neutral
"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?",neutral
"No, bribes.",neutral
"Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",neutral
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
They did it right there on the couch.,neutral
Who's he sleeping with?,neutral
"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...",neutral
"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.",neutral
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",neutral
So where did you study?,neutral
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",neutral
"No, where did you study acting?",neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,neutral
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",neutral
"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",neutral
Thanx.,neutral
"Hi, is Molly here?",neutral
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",neutral
"Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.",neutral
"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Not a problem.,neutral
I totally understand.,neutral
You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos.,neutral
Don’t you worry. I have nothing to hide.,neutral
"So there you go, that’s me.",neutral
This room’s available.,neutral
Uh Rach,neutral
I don’t think the next patient is very far along.,neutral
"Okay, well then bring her in.",neutral
They don’t look any bigger than me!,neutral
I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?,neutral
All right.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,neutral
"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.",neutral
We just want you to think it through.,neutral
"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?",neutral
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.,neutral
"Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",neutral
Thank you. All right.,neutral
"Come, sit.",neutral
Sit.,neutral
"Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",neutral
Lucky sixes....,neutral
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",neutral
Hi!,neutral
And Joey....,neutral
Hi!,neutral
And Ross.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
He doesn't speak much English.,neutral
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",neutral
"Oh... Italy, I think.",neutral
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",neutral
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",neutral
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",neutral
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,neutral
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",neutral
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",neutral
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",neutral
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.,neutral
"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.",neutral
I know I do.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral

"All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",neutral
"All right, all right, all right.",neutral
"I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it.",neutral
"Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",neutral
How ya feelin’?,neutral
"Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",neutral
Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",neutral
What is the worse part?,neutral
"But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",neutral
It’s a trifle.,neutral
It’s got all of these layers.,neutral
"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral
"then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",neutral
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?,neutral
"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",neutral
"Folks, has this ever happened to you.",neutral
"You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.",neutral
And there is Kevin.,neutral
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.,neutral
"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.",neutral
Go ahead.,neutral
This works with any milk carton.,neutral
"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.",neutral
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",neutral
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.,neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,neutral
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,neutral
"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",neutral

"Oh, Chandler, Wayne.",neutral
"Wayne, Chandler.",neutral
"Hi, how are ya?",neutral
"Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out.",neutral
The reason he just said.,neutral
What do you need?,neutral
"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah?",neutral
And I too am just a love machine.,neutral
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.",neutral
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",neutral
Y'know?,neutral
No I'm not.,neutral
"Oh hey, Ross.",neutral
Something to think about.,neutral

"Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?",neutral
"Oh, um, Chandler?",neutral
"Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.",neutral
"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",neutral
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",neutral
Do you have a dressing room?,neutral
Do you have a chair with your name on it?,neutral
"Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.",neutral
"Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!",neutral
"I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",neutral

"Well, I never call",neutral
What ‘cha doing?,neutral
Having a swim.,neutral
What about the chick?,neutral
Chicks don’t swim.,neutral
Are you sure?,neutral
I don’t know. Should we try it?,neutral
Sure.,neutral
"See, I told you they don’t swim.",neutral
Wait. Give him a minute.,neutral
"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?",neutral
You guys feel safe.,neutral
Right?,neutral
"Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!""",neutral
"Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one.",neutral
I just have to clean that up.,neutral
Okay?,neutral
"‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"Well, that’s just the way that goes.",neutral
"Okay, good.",neutral
"Well, you can’t answer.",neutral
Leslie?,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oh, there’s banana on it.",neutral
"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",neutral
"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",neutral
"Why, does she have a bad personality?",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oooh, wrong answer.",neutral
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.,neutral
"Honey, I was wondering....",neutral
Hmm?,neutral
Hmm.,neutral
"Well honey, what about you?",neutral
What?,neutral
"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",neutral
No.,neutral
That's OK.,neutral
We can't do that.,neutral
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...",neutral
"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",neutral
"Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",neutral
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",neutral
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",neutral
"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",neutral
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral
That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,neutral
A new grocery store.,neutral
"Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",neutral
"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",neutral
"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",neutral
"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral
"All right, let me in.",neutral
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",neutral
All right.,neutral
"Baking it didn't help, huh?",neutral
"All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",neutral
"Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me?",neutral
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",neutral
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",neutral
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral
She's not much of a phone person.,neutral
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",neutral
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",neutral
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,neutral
"Oh, that is so not true.",neutral
"Oh, it is.",neutral
It isn't.,neutral
It is.,neutral
"Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there.",neutral
Thanks.,neutral
"Yeah, yeah, I was watching.",neutral
"Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.",neutral
"Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them",neutral
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,neutral
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.",neutral
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later.",neutral
"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on",neutral
They’re all Chandler.,neutral
I did.  But it came at a price.,neutral
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral
"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral

"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.",neutral
"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral
What?,neutral
Frannie was the one who found your,neutral
"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",neutral
I believe you know my husband.,neutral
So it’s really a question of,neutral

"Man to uh, me.",neutral

"What, wait, you mean like this?",neutral
Your not doing it.,neutral
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment.,neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,neutral
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",neutral
"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,neutral

"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",neutral
Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,neutral
Oh? Why not?,neutral
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,neutral
So why can’t the three of us go out together?,neutral
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.",neutral
"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",neutral
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",neutral
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",neutral

"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.",neutral
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.,neutral

"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",neutral
"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",neutral
Do I know why we’re rushing?,neutral

You forget how many great songs Heart had.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",neutral
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",neutral
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.,neutral

"Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?",neutral
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.,neutral
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",neutral
Would ya care to venture one?,neutral
Would,neutral
"All right, let's move on.",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.",neutral
"And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she?",neutral
"Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.",neutral

"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral

"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral

"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral

Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral

"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral
Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like,neutral
"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral
Someone in there?,neutral
"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.",neutral
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",neutral

"Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",neutral
Don’t you have to use the bathroom?,neutral
"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral
You're definitely scaring here.,neutral

"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the",neutral
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a",neutral
"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",neutral
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
You’re welcome.,neutral
Gin.,neutral
Okay. All right.,neutral
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?",neutral
Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",neutral
"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",neutral
Okay .,neutral

"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral

"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral

"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral

"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral
"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral
I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral
Which is why,neutral

"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",neutral

"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral

"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral

"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral

"No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",neutral
"Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.",neutral
"Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",neutral
Hello.,neutral
"Hey, what do you want to drink?",neutral
Nobody.,neutral
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?,neutral
Is that Mark?,neutral
"Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",neutral
"Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.",neutral
"Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.",neutral
"Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.",neutral
You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.,neutral
Sure.,neutral
What contracts?,neutral
Like what?,neutral
"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.",neutral
You wanna go down to the office right now?,neutral
Okay I understand.  I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.,neutral
"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.",neutral
Nice to meet you.,neutral
Oh and I need to talk to you.,neutral
About what?,neutral
To see if know what these guys are talking about.,neutral
"Pheebs, how’s it going?",neutral

"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?",neutral
"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
...I dunno.,neutral
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,neutral
"Hey, Phoebe.",neutral
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",neutral
Can I help you?,neutral
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",neutral
He’s not here right now.,neutral
"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
I’m an actor. I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.,neutral
"Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.",neutral
"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral
"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",neutral
Yes.,neutral
I guess.,neutral
"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",neutral
"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral
-Peaches?,neutral
"Actually, nectarines, but basically...",neutral
Could've been a peach.,neutral
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral
Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like,neutral
"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral
Someone in there?,neutral
"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.",neutral
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",neutral
Ginger.,neutral
"Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",neutral
Don’t you have to use the bathroom?,neutral
"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral
You're definitely scaring here.,neutral
Would you like to call somebody?,neutral
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.",neutral
Oh,neutral
It’s my sister.,neutral
"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the",neutral
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a",neutral
"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",neutral
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral

I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral

"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral

Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral

"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
Here you go.,neutral

"Well, if you want, you can work here.",neutral
"Uh, I don’t know.",neutral
"Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know?",neutral
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",neutral
Flexible hours.,neutral
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,neutral
I have no name.,neutral
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",neutral
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",neutral
"Umm, Gene.",neutral

"Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",neutral
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
They did it right there on the couch.,neutral
Who's he sleeping with?,neutral
"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...",neutral
"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.",neutral
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",neutral
So where did you study?,neutral
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",neutral
"No, where did you study acting?",neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,neutral
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",neutral
"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",neutral
Thanx.,neutral
"Hi, is Molly here?",neutral
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",neutral
"Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.",neutral
"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Not a problem.,neutral
I totally understand.,neutral
You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos.,neutral
Don’t you worry. I have nothing to hide.,neutral
"So there you go, that’s me.",neutral
This room’s available.,neutral

"Okay, well then bring her in.",neutral
They don’t look any bigger than me!,neutral
I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?,neutral
All right.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,neutral
"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.",neutral
We just want you to think it through.,neutral
"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?",neutral
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.,neutral
"Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",neutral
Thank you. All right.,neutral
"Come, sit.",neutral
Sit.,neutral
"Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",neutral
Lucky sixes....,neutral
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",neutral
Hi!,neutral
And Joey....,neutral
Hi!,neutral
And Ross.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
He doesn't speak much English.,neutral
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",neutral
"Oh... Italy, I think.",neutral
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",neutral
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",neutral
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",neutral
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,neutral
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",neutral
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",neutral
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",neutral
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.,neutral
"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.",neutral
I know I do.,neutral
Hi.,neutral

"All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",neutral
"All right, all right, all right.",neutral
"I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it.",neutral
"Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",neutral
How ya feelin’?,neutral
"Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",neutral
Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",neutral
What is the worse part?,neutral
"But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",neutral
It’s a trifle.,neutral
It’s got all of these layers.,neutral
"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral
"then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",neutral
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?,neutral
"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",neutral
"Folks, has this ever happened to you.",neutral
"You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.",neutral
And there is Kevin.,neutral
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.,neutral
"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.",neutral
Go ahead.,neutral
This works with any milk carton.,neutral
"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.",neutral
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",neutral
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.,neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,neutral
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,neutral
"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",neutral

The reason he just said.,neutral
What do you need?,neutral
"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah?",neutral
And I too am just a love machine.,neutral
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.",neutral
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",neutral
Y'know?,neutral
No I'm not.,neutral
"Oh hey, Ross.",neutral
Something to think about.,neutral

"Oh, um, Chandler?",neutral
"Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.",neutral
"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",neutral
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",neutral
Do you have a dressing room?,neutral
Do you have a chair with your name on it?,neutral
"Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.",neutral
"Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!",neutral
"I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",neutral

"Well, I never call",neutral
What ‘cha doing?,neutral
Having a swim.,neutral
What about the chick?,neutral
Chicks don’t swim.,neutral

I don’t know. Should we try it?,neutral
Sure.,neutral
"See, I told you they don’t swim.",neutral
Wait. Give him a minute.,neutral
"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?",neutral
You guys feel safe.,neutral
Right?,neutral
"Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!""",neutral
"Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one.",neutral
I just have to clean that up.,neutral
Okay?,neutral

All right.,neutral
"Well, that’s just the way that goes.",neutral
"Okay, good.",neutral
"Well, you can’t answer.",neutral
Leslie?,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oh, there’s banana on it.",neutral
"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",neutral
"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",neutral
"Why, does she have a bad personality?",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oooh, wrong answer.",neutral
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.,neutral
"Honey, I was wondering....",neutral
Hmm?,neutral
Hmm.,neutral
"Well honey, what about you?",neutral
What?,neutral
"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",neutral
No.,neutral
That's OK.,neutral
We can't do that.,neutral
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...",neutral
"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",neutral
"Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",neutral
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",neutral
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",neutral
"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",neutral
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral
That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,neutral
A new grocery store.,neutral
"Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",neutral
"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",neutral
"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",neutral
"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral
"All right, let me in.",neutral
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",neutral
All right.,neutral
"Baking it didn't help, huh?",neutral
"All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",neutral
"Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me?",neutral
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",neutral
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",neutral
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral
She's not much of a phone person.,neutral
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",neutral
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",neutral
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,neutral
"Oh, that is so not true.",neutral
"Oh, it is.",neutral
It isn't.,neutral
It is.,neutral
"Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there.",neutral
Thanks.,neutral
"Yeah, yeah, I was watching.",neutral
"Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.",neutral
"Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them",neutral
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,neutral
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.",neutral
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later.",neutral
"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on",neutral
They’re all Chandler.,neutral
I did.  But it came at a price.,neutral
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral
"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral
I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral
Which is why,neutral
"No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.",neutral

"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral
What?,neutral

"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment.,neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,neutral
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",neutral
"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,neutral

Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,neutral
Oh? Why not?,neutral
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,neutral
So why can’t the three of us go out together?,neutral
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.",neutral
"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",neutral
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",neutral
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",neutral

"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.",neutral
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.,neutral

"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",neutral
"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",neutral
Do I know why we’re rushing?,neutral

You forget how many great songs Heart had.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",neutral
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",neutral
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral

"Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?",neutral
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.,neutral
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",neutral
Would ya care to venture one?,neutral
Would,neutral
"All right, let's move on.",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.",neutral

"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral

"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral

"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral

"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral

"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral

Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral

"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral

Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral

Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral

What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral

"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral

What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral

"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral

"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
You’re welcome.,neutral
Gin.,neutral
Okay. All right.,neutral
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?",neutral
Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",neutral
"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",neutral
"Well, if you want, you can work here.",neutral
"Uh, I don’t know.",neutral
"Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know?",neutral
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",neutral
Flexible hours.,neutral
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,neutral

"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral

"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",neutral
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral
That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,neutral
A new grocery store.,neutral

"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",neutral
"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",neutral
"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral
"All right, let me in.",neutral
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",neutral
All right.,neutral

"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",neutral
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",neutral
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral
She's not much of a phone person.,neutral
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",neutral

I did.  But it came at a price.,neutral
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral
"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral
I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral
Which is why,neutral
"No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.",neutral
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",neutral

"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral

"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",neutral

"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral

"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.",neutral
"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",neutral
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",neutral
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",neutral

"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral

"Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.",neutral
"Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.",neutral
You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.,neutral
Sure.,neutral
What contracts?,neutral
Like what?,neutral
"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.",neutral
You wanna go down to the office right now?,neutral
Okay I understand.  I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.,neutral
"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.",neutral
Nice to meet you.,neutral
Oh and I need to talk to you.,neutral
About what?,neutral
To see if know what these guys are talking about.,neutral
"Pheebs, how’s it going?",neutral
I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?,neutral
"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?",neutral
"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
...I dunno.,neutral
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,neutral
"Hey, Phoebe.",neutral
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",neutral
Can I help you?,neutral
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",neutral
He’s not here right now.,neutral
"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
I’m an actor. I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.,neutral
"Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.",neutral
"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral
"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",neutral
Yes.,neutral
I guess.,neutral
"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",neutral
"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral
-Peaches?,neutral
"Actually, nectarines, but basically...",neutral
Could've been a peach.,neutral
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
Ask again later.,neutral
"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral
Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like,neutral
"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,neutral
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",neutral
I don't see why not.,neutral
Here's my retainer!,neutral
Someone in there?,neutral
"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.",neutral
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.",neutral
Ginger.,neutral
"Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",neutral
Don’t you have to use the bathroom?,neutral
"Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
"Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.",neutral
Someone in here.,neutral
"Oh, just years of experience.",neutral
You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?,neutral
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me",neutral
I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?,neutral
Feel better?,neutral
"Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
I don’t think so.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
$4.50 please.,neutral
"Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.",neutral
"Alright, alright, alright.",neutral
You're definitely scaring here.,neutral
Would you like to call somebody?,neutral
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.",neutral
Oh,neutral
It’s my sister.,neutral
"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the",neutral
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a",neutral
"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",neutral
"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Why, nobody good?",neutral
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing",neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow?,neutral
Two.,neutral
"This photographer, who seemed really dull.",neutral
"And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",neutral
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!",neutral
What?,neutral
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",neutral
"Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",neutral
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Well, how-how come?",neutral
That’s just the way it is.,neutral
"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.",neutral
"See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter!",neutral
"Hey, Peter!",neutral
It’s me Rhonda!,neutral
From PS-129!,neutral
I gave you my,neutral
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.,neutral
"Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he",neutral
"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey.",neutral
"Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.",neutral
"How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?",neutral
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",neutral
"I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",neutral
Op.,neutral
"Oh, you got me.",neutral
"Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential.",neutral
"Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion.",neutral
How does that sound?,neutral
"Come on over here, sweetheart.",neutral
No. But thanks.,neutral
Okay. No. But thanks.,neutral
"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.",neutral
"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.",neutral
"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know.",neutral
"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,",neutral
"I'm, I'm really sorry.",neutral
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.",neutral
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",neutral
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel.",neutral
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.,neutral
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go.,neutral
"Sure, it’s hard to forget!",neutral
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it!,neutral
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.",neutral
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",neutral
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",neutral
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",neutral
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",neutral
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",neutral
"Hold on, y’know I",neutral
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",neutral
"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but",neutral
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",neutral
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.",neutral
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",neutral
For the ride.,neutral
"Yeah, like in a cab...",neutral
Save it.,neutral
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.",neutral
"Here we go, here we go.",neutral
"Rossy, Rossy.",neutral
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,neutral
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",neutral
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",neutral
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",neutral
"Oh, sure, they love us over there.",neutral
How about Joey... Pepponi?,neutral
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",neutral
Joey... Switzerland?,neutral
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.",neutral
"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.",neutral
Which I'm not.,neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,neutral
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",neutral
Might wanna try Joseph.,neutral
"Okay, look.",neutral
"Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey.",neutral
I’m not arguing with that.,neutral
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",neutral
It’s your joke.,neutral
"Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.",neutral
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",neutral
And it can't be Joey.,neutral
It's not.,neutral
Or Joseph.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
Well...,neutral
You want some coffee?,neutral
"Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",neutral
Regular or decaf?,neutral
"Ah, which ever is closest.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So ask me what I did today.,neutral
So what did you do today Pete?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Where've you been?,neutral
At the vet.,neutral
So what does this mean?,neutral
I sure did.,neutral
May I come in?,neutral
"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",neutral
Do,neutral
"Yeah, sure?",neutral
So do I.,neutral
"Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.",neutral
This is just about tonight.,neutral
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""",neutral
"And um, what-what is that Ross?",neutral
Ah Joey.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
"Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.",neutral
"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",neutral
"Aw come on Joey, it's easy.",neutral
"Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!",neutral
Have fun.,neutral
Bye.,neutral
Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",neutral
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",neutral
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",neutral
What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?,neutral
Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
Fine.,neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Come on, Lydia, you can do it.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You got it?,neutral
"Oh, okay, I get it.",neutral
Howard's the,neutral
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",neutral
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",neutral
"They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
You mind if I,neutral
"No, please.",neutral
"So uh, what are you in for?",neutral
I talk in my sleep.,neutral
"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",neutral
So why don’t you give me your number?,neutral
Previously on Friends.,neutral
I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.,neutral
"Yeah, but without the costumes.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re",neutral
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",neutral
"Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",neutral
"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",neutral
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,neutral
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.",neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not so bad.",neutral
"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",neutral
How’s your room Rach?,neutral
Isn’t that mine?,neutral
"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?",neutral
"Yes, they can stay with us.",neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,neutral
"I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.",neutral
I don’t know if you’d understand.,neutral
"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",neutral
So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.,neutral
Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ross, we can handle this.",neutral
"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",neutral
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",neutral
Why do you do it?,neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I do.",neutral
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",neutral
"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",neutral
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",neutral
"You just take a big, big swing.",neutral
"Now, don’t hold back.",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
"Oh, all right.",neutral
Bye!,neutral
Bye!,neutral
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",neutral
"Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey.",neutral
"Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",neutral
"Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",neutral
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?,neutral
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",neutral
Because we can remember them.,neutral
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,neutral
I was always Joanne.,neutral
"Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",neutral
"All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,neutral
Um. yeah.,neutral
I am,neutral
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",neutral
"So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",neutral
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",neutral
"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",neutral
"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",neutral
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",neutral
"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",neutral
It looks like a women's purse.,neutral
"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",neutral
"See look,",neutral
Exactly! Unisex!,neutral
Maybe you need sex.,neutral
"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",neutral
"So, um, have you told your parents?",neutral
"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",neutral
What?,neutral
"So, this isn't over?",neutral
"No, it was a fight.",neutral
It's nothing to freak out about.,neutral
I'm afraid so.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
So you like the short hair better.,neutral
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,neutral
Can I tell you a little secret?,neutral
I want to keep one.,neutral
What? Honey.,neutral
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Got a job on a river boat?,neutral
"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",neutral
You like it right?,neutral
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!,neutral
"Yeah, come here!",neutral
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?,neutral
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Oh uh, up or down?",neutral
Could you press up too please?,neutral
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?,neutral
"Well, it’s a long story.",neutral
It’s kind of embarrassing.,neutral
How about you?,neutral
"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?",neutral
"Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, that’s me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.",neutral
"Uh-huh, yeah.",neutral
"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else",neutral
"Uh, you gotta press the button.",neutral
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",neutral
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.",neutral
There's a forest right outside.,neutral
It's not the same.,neutral
"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",neutral
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?",neutral
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.",neutral
"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.",neutral
"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not so sure.",neutral
"Well, you’re not.",neutral
"I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy.",neutral
"I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right?",neutral
"He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.",neutral
"Y’know, give him my flower.",neutral
"Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever",neutral
"Push, push!",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Long story, honey.",neutral
"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?",neutral
C'mon up.,neutral
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",neutral
"So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",neutral
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,neutral
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",neutral
I thought he was with you.,neutral
"He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",neutral
"You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.",neutral
"You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",neutral
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",neutral
"But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",neutral
"Honey, it isn’t good luck.",neutral
"I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",neutral
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.,neutral
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.",neutral
"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",neutral
"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",neutral
Because we’re girls.,neutral
"Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?",neutral
"Yeah, like I could",neutral
"Yeah—no, just that last song.",neutral
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",neutral
"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",neutral
The players.,neutral
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,neutral
"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",neutral
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",neutral
Oh.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
I don’t want to say.,neutral
Diane Keaton.,neutral
"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.",neutral
"No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",neutral
"Fair enough, now go get ready!",neutral
"I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",neutral
"Though late one night, not much light, I....",neutral
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?""",neutral
"""Can’t, its not there.""",neutral
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",neutral
Not once did we do that.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",neutral
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",neutral
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",neutral
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator",neutral
"Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",neutral
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",neutral
Monica? What time is it?,neutral
"Uhh, 9.",neutral
But it's dark out.,neutral
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",neutral
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,neutral
I'm,neutral
"I know, me too.",neutral
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?,neutral
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",neutral
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.",neutral
Wait! What about Joey?,neutral
"Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?",neutral
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,neutral
You didn’t bring,neutral
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",neutral
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,neutral
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",neutral
"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",neutral
But Rachel has an apartment.,neutral
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",neutral
I guess I didn’t really think about it.,neutral
Little village people.,neutral
"Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",neutral
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",neutral
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,neutral
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,neutral
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,neutral
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",neutral
"Well, you would know.",neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,neutral
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked.,neutral
"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",neutral
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there .",neutral
Do you really?,neutral

Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
I bet he can.,neutral
"Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?",neutral
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,neutral
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",neutral
"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",neutral
"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",neutral
"Well, if you want, you can work here.",neutral
"Uh, I don’t know.",neutral
"Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know?",neutral
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",neutral
Flexible hours.,neutral
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,neutral
I have no name.,neutral
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",neutral
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",neutral
"Umm, Gene.",neutral

"Bye, Gene.",neutral
Welcome to Las Vegas.,neutral
Hope you had a nice flight.,neutral
"Oh, Larry.",neutral
"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?",neutral
"No, bribes.",neutral
"Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",neutral
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
They did it right there on the couch.,neutral
Who's he sleeping with?,neutral
"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...",neutral
"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.",neutral
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",neutral
So where did you study?,neutral
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",neutral
"No, where did you study acting?",neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,neutral
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",neutral
"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",neutral
Thanx.,neutral
"Hi, is Molly here?",neutral
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",neutral
"Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.",neutral
"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Not a problem.,neutral
I totally understand.,neutral
You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos.,neutral
Don’t you worry. I have nothing to hide.,neutral
"So there you go, that’s me.",neutral
This room’s available.,neutral
Uh Rach,neutral
I don’t think the next patient is very far along.,neutral
"Okay, well then bring her in.",neutral
They don’t look any bigger than me!,neutral
I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?,neutral
All right.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,neutral
"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.",neutral
We just want you to think it through.,neutral
"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?",neutral
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.,neutral
"Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",neutral
Thank you. All right.,neutral
"Come, sit.",neutral
Sit.,neutral
"Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",neutral
Lucky sixes....,neutral
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",neutral
Hi!,neutral
And Joey....,neutral
Hi!,neutral
And Ross.,neutral
Hi!,neutral
He doesn't speak much English.,neutral
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",neutral
"Oh... Italy, I think.",neutral
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",neutral
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",neutral
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",neutral
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,neutral
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",neutral
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",neutral
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",neutral
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.,neutral
"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.",neutral
I know I do.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral

"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",neutral
Oh.,neutral

"All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",neutral
"All right, all right, all right.",neutral
"I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it.",neutral
"Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",neutral
How ya feelin’?,neutral
"Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",neutral
Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",neutral
What is the worse part?,neutral
"But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",neutral
It’s a trifle.,neutral
It’s got all of these layers.,neutral
"First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.",neutral
"[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.]",neutral
"then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",neutral
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?,neutral
"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",neutral
"Folks, has this ever happened to you.",neutral
"You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.",neutral
And there is Kevin.,neutral
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.,neutral
"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.",neutral
Go ahead.,neutral
This works with any milk carton.,neutral
"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.",neutral
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",neutral
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.,neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,neutral
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,neutral
"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",neutral

"Oh, Chandler, Wayne.",neutral
"Wayne, Chandler.",neutral
"Hi, how are ya?",neutral
"Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out.",neutral
The reason he just said.,neutral
What do you need?,neutral
"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah?",neutral
And I too am just a love machine.,neutral
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.",neutral
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",neutral
Y'know?,neutral
No I'm not.,neutral
"Oh hey, Ross.",neutral
Something to think about.,neutral

"Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?",neutral
"Oh, um, Chandler?",neutral
"Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.",neutral
"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",neutral
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?",neutral
Do you have a dressing room?,neutral
Do you have a chair with your name on it?,neutral
"Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.",neutral
"Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!",neutral
"I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",neutral

"Well, I never call",neutral
What ‘cha doing?,neutral
Having a swim.,neutral
What about the chick?,neutral
Chicks don’t swim.,neutral
Are you sure?,neutral
I don’t know. Should we try it?,neutral
Sure.,neutral
"See, I told you they don’t swim.",neutral
Wait. Give him a minute.,neutral
"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?",neutral
You guys feel safe.,neutral
Right?,neutral
"Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!""",neutral
"Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one.",neutral
I just have to clean that up.,neutral
Okay?,neutral
"‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"Well, that’s just the way that goes.",neutral
"Okay, good.",neutral
"Well, you can’t answer.",neutral
Leslie?,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oh, there’s banana on it.",neutral
"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",neutral
"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",neutral
"Why, does she have a bad personality?",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Oooh, wrong answer.",neutral
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.,neutral
"Honey, I was wondering....",neutral
Hmm?,neutral
Hmm.,neutral
"Well honey, what about you?",neutral
What?,neutral
"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",neutral
No.,neutral
That's OK.,neutral
We can't do that.,neutral
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...",neutral
"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",neutral
"Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",neutral
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",neutral
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",neutral
"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",neutral
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.",neutral
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",neutral
Oh there it is.,neutral
That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,neutral
A new grocery store.,neutral
"Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",neutral
"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",neutral
"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",neutral
"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",neutral
A little.   Now you’re talking.,neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral
She must’ve left.,neutral
"All right, let me in.",neutral
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",neutral
All right.,neutral
"Baking it didn't help, huh?",neutral
"All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",neutral
"Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me?",neutral
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",neutral
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",neutral
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral
She's not much of a phone person.,neutral
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",neutral
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",neutral
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,neutral
"Oh, that is so not true.",neutral
"Oh, it is.",neutral
It isn't.,neutral
It is.,neutral
"Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there.",neutral
Thanks.,neutral
"Yeah, yeah, I was watching.",neutral
"Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.",neutral
"Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them",neutral
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,neutral
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.",neutral
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later.",neutral
"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on",neutral
They’re all Chandler.,neutral
I did.  But it came at a price.,neutral
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral
"Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",neutral
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?",neutral
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral
I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral
Which is why,neutral
"No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.",neutral
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but",neutral
Cat.,neutral
"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!",neutral
I don't know.,neutral
That's,neutral
"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has",neutral
But,neutral
"Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",neutral
Because I’m dumping him today.,neutral
He,neutral

"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.",neutral
"Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.",neutral
"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",neutral
All right.,neutral
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",neutral
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,neutral
I would really love it if I could do both.,neutral
What?,neutral
Frannie was the one who found your,neutral
"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",neutral
I believe you know my husband.,neutral
So it’s really a question of,neutral

"Man to uh, me.",neutral
Sure. Okay.,neutral
"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.",neutral

"What, wait, you mean like this?",neutral
Your not doing it.,neutral
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment.,neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,neutral
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",neutral
"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",neutral
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",neutral
You think?,neutral
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,neutral

"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",neutral
Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,neutral
Oh? Why not?,neutral
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,neutral
So why can’t the three of us go out together?,neutral
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.",neutral
"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",neutral
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",neutral
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",neutral

"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.",neutral
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.,neutral
Did he call?,neutral
"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",neutral
"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",neutral
Do I know why we’re rushing?,neutral
"Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?",neutral

You forget how many great songs Heart had.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",neutral
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",neutral
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",neutral
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",neutral
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,neutral
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",neutral
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",neutral
"Okay, look, just do it gently.",neutral
You’re right.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.,neutral

"Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?",neutral
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.,neutral
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",neutral
Would ya care to venture one?,neutral
Would,neutral
"All right, let's move on.",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.",neutral
"And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she?",neutral
"Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.",neutral

"Oh right, Coach Ruben.",neutral
Do you know what Pheebs?,neutral
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",neutral
See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.,neutral
"Uh,",neutral
"...I'm, I'm okay.",neutral
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Bye.,neutral

"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",neutral
Can I help you?,neutral
"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",neutral

"All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.",neutral
Okay?,neutral

"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right?",neutral
I mean hi.,neutral
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",neutral

"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",neutral
"Yeah, we’re done.",neutral
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",neutral
"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",neutral
"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,neutral
"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",neutral
"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",neutral
"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",neutral
"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.",neutral
"So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke?,neutral
"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",neutral
What?,neutral
Peach pit.,neutral
"Yes, Bunny?",neutral
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-",neutral

Okay.,neutral
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",neutral
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",neutral
"Man,",neutral
"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",neutral
"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!",neutral
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",neutral
What?,neutral
Rachel?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?",neutral
"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"No, you said the baby creeps you out.",neutral
You said the baby.,neutral
"You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",neutral
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.,neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.,neutral
"Okay, why don’t we all uh,  open our books to page 23.",neutral
Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.,neutral
"Okay,  umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—",neutral
"Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?,neutral
Miss? May I help you?,neutral
"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.",neutral
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,neutral
Of course not.,neutral
Of course!,neutral
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit",neutral
Okay then.,neutral
Here we go.,neutral
"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?",neutral
Ask again later.,neutral

"All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",neutral
"Come on, two on one.",neutral
My Catholic friend is right.,neutral
She's distraught.,neutral
You're there for her.,neutral
"Well, I just called Joshua",neutral
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",neutral
What did he say?,neutral
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",neutral
I got in there myself once.,neutral
"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,neutral
"No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.",neutral
"All right, you have yourself a deal.",neutral
Hey! What’s up?,neutral
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",neutral
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.,neutral
I mean you definitely should do that.,neutral
"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",neutral
All right.,neutral
You're not an artist.,neutral
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",neutral
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",neutral
I know. My arm is killing me.,neutral
"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.,neutral
What’s the matter?,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Rach come on, what?",neutral
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",neutral
"Yeah, I guess so.",neutral
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",neutral
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",neutral
"Well, we should go.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",neutral
Oh please.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral
"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.",neutral
"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral
Just go for it Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah, you should.",neutral
"Yeah, you should, really.",neutral
"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.",neutral
"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",neutral
"Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again.",neutral
Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like,neutral
"July. Umm,",neutral
"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.",neutral
"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.",neutral
Bye Phoebe.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Monica and Rachel made out.,neutral
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
No!,neutral
"I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",neutral
And we didn’t have sex.,neutral
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",neutral
Tell me about it.,neutral
What are we gonna do?,neutral
I say we go with,neutral
Chandler?,neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,neutral
"Hi, remember us?",neutral
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a",neutral
I am. I'm,neutral
"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",neutral
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",neutral
Y’know what? It,neutral
Sorry.,neutral
What am I making him by the way?,neutral
"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",neutral
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral
"Y’know it’s like uh, Biology!",neutral
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",neutral
"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",neutral
You are falling fast asleep.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
Deeper.,neutral
You are now completely asleep.,neutral
You don’t need to smoke.,neutral
Cigarettes don’t control you.,neutral
"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",neutral
"A strong, confident woman.",neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,neutral
No.,neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,neutral
So how are things going with Paul?,neutral
"Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.",neutral
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,neutral
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral
Hi honey.,neutral
You said number two.,neutral
I also said number one.,neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,neutral
Can’t I just look at the handles on them?,neutral
You would think.,neutral
"Okay, fine.",neutral
"Because, I don’t care.",neutral
I don’t care.,neutral
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",neutral
"Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",neutral
"But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",neutral
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",neutral
"It’s uh, right through there.",neutral
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",neutral
"Please, just a little bit off the back.",neutral
"I'm still on ""no.""",neutral
"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",neutral
What's goin' on?,neutral
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",neutral
What stupid thing did you do?,neutral
I know.,neutral
"See, yes.",neutral
"That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick.",neutral
I love you both.,neutral
But in very different ways.,neutral
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",neutral
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",neutral
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",neutral
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",neutral
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,neutral
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",neutral
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",neutral
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",neutral
Um...  Done!,neutral
"Okay, it’s coffee.",neutral
It’s-it’s hot,neutral
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?,neutral
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",neutral
Yeah,neutral
"Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.",neutral
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",neutral
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,neutral
It's creamier.,neutral
"Yeah, well, is that",neutral
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",neutral

Hi there.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",neutral
"So, keep having sex on a regular basis.",neutral
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",neutral
"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",neutral
Ok.,neutral
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",neutral
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",neutral

"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...",neutral
Come in.,neutral

What's it look like?,neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin.,neutral
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",neutral
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",neutral
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",neutral
I have no idea what you just said.,neutral
Put Joey on the phone.,neutral
What's up man?,neutral
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.",neutral
and that was all before 10 o’clock.,neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.,neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips.,neutral
"Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",neutral
Where’s Chandler?,neutral

Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.,neutral
"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",neutral
"Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",neutral

What are you guys doing?,neutral
"Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",neutral
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this",neutral
"Yeah, I’m not in that.",neutral
"Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",neutral
"Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",neutral
Chandler what do you say?,neutral
"All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.",neutral
You just wanna each take one?,neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.,neutral
Well,neutral
Why don’t you phase it out?,neutral
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",neutral
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,neutral
I think you look fine.,neutral
