"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",negative
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",negative
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",negative
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!",negative

"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",negative
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",negative
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",negative
We said seven!,negative
We said six!,negative
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",negative
"You, get out of my shop!",negative
He went out with my wife!,negative
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did",negative

"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?",negative
"I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do.",negative
"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",negative
"I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",negative
"If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",negative
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,negative
You idiot!!,negative
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",negative
"What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!",negative
Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative

"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative

"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative

"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative

Pants and a sweater?,negative

Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?,negative
Power company guys?,negative
Eligible looters?,negative

"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got",negative
"I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.",negative
"Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!",negative
Then don't break in!!,negative
"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",negative
"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",negative
Not at these prices.,negative
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",negative
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",negative
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,negative
Really stupid.,negative
Yeah. No. No...,negative
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?,negative
When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,negative
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,negative
He's a dropper!,negative
"Oh yeah, that's right!",negative
I'm not a dropper!,negative
It's throwing and catching!,negative
"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",negative
"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",negative
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",negative
"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.",negative
Maybe you should.,negative
Isn't!,negative
No. No-no. No. What would,negative
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,negative
"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",negative
Are you mocking me?,negative
Why not?!,negative
No!,negative
"All right, bye!",negative
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!,negative
I came with Paul!,negative
Get up!,negative
What the hell was that?!,negative
Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,negative
Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,negative
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",negative
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?,negative
I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!,negative
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,negative
I can't write!,negative
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",negative
"Yes, yes it is. It’s uh…  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!",negative
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.",negative
That bitch!,negative
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!,negative
"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!",negative
What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding?,negative
What could I have possibly done?!,negative
Stuart!,negative
"Yeah, get out!",negative
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!,negative
"Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?",negative
"Come on, wussies!",negative
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!,negative
Y’know she has a face Ross!,negative
"I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",negative
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,negative
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",negative
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,negative
"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",negative
": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",negative
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",negative
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",negative
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",negative
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!",negative
Is that too much to ask after six years?!,negative
I mean what?,negative
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!,negative
I mean do we not have as much fun?!,negative
Hey!,negative
I did not cry my eyes out!!,negative
"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",negative
DO YOU?,negative
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,negative
I can’t find garbage bags!,negative
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.",negative
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,negative
You completely stole my answer!,negative
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,negative
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,negative
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",negative
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,negative
The Hardy boys?,negative
"Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right?",negative
"I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?",negative
You can’t marry him!,negative
"Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",negative
I can and I will!,negative
Hey!,negative
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!,negative
People have got to finish their stories!,negative
No!,negative
They are completely different—Okay!,negative
Yeah! Got it!,negative
Tag!,negative

This isn’t funny!,negative
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!,negative
Yes I did! And I put a little,negative
"Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",negative
"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are",negative
"No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.",negative
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,negative
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",negative
"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?",negative
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",negative
Hey!!,negative
"Oh, you’re kidding me!",negative
There’s nothing sexual about this?,negative
What are you looking at?!,negative
To Put the Camera Away!!!,negative
"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.",negative
"No, the little girl creeps me out.",negative
Why would the baby creep me out?,negative
Why would the little girl creep you out?,negative
"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",negative
"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is",negative
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",negative
"I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!",negative
"So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!",negative
'Cause I-I got nothing!,negative
"All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.",negative
Later is not good enough.,negative
What the hell!,negative
This is broken!,negative
It-it is broken!,negative
"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",negative
"You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",negative
It was in my room all night!,negative
"And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did?",negative
Shh!,negative
We’re trying to think!,negative
"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",negative
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",negative
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",negative
We said seven!,negative
We said six!,negative
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",negative
"You, get out of my shop!",negative
He went out with my wife!,negative
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did",negative
That’s my wife!!! Get out!,negative
"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.",negative
I know!,negative
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",negative
"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?",negative
"I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do.",negative
"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",negative
"I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",negative
"If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",negative
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,negative
You idiot!!,negative
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",negative
"What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!",negative
Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",negative
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’,negative
"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,negative
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,negative
"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative
Fine!,negative
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility!",negative
“...I can begin to trust you again.,negative
Does that seem like something you can do.,negative
Does it?!,negative
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",negative
"All right, all right.",negative
"All right, I'm going. I'm going.",negative
WHAT IS IT?!,negative
Monkey into man?,negative
I’m Doctor Monkey!,negative
"You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!",negative
Now let it go!,negative
The joke sucks!,negative
Is not.,negative
"Did you, did you",negative
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,negative
Then don't touch one!!,negative
Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again!,negative
Hang on buddy!,negative
"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!",negative
"Oh, DAMN IT!",negative
"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",negative
"Well, up yours too!",negative
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",negative
Gimme them!,negative
No! They are mine!,negative
You stole them from me!,negative
You stole them from me!!,negative
Gimme them!,negative
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",negative
"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time!",negative
You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler.,negative
Joey! He’s working!  You would look,negative
Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!,negative
There’s just so much pressure.,negative
"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",negative
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",negative
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,negative
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,negative
What a wank!,negative
"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",negative
I know!,negative
"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",negative
And I’m appalled for you by the way.,negative
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",negative
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",negative
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",negative
Like me tiny doctor!’,negative
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",negative
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",negative
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",negative
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,negative
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,negative
Ow!!,negative
"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",negative
"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",negative
"Okay, good bye!",negative
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,negative
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!,negative
"Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",negative
"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!",negative
"Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",negative
"It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities.",negative
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,negative
There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!,negative
Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,negative
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,negative
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,negative
"So, I hear, you hate me!",negative
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,negative
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",negative
But what does that gonna do...,negative
For Chandler!,negative
"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",negative
I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.,negative
It’s Joshua.,negative
Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go!  Come on!  Why aren’t you dressed yet?!,negative
"Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.",negative
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!,negative
Damnit!,negative
"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",negative
Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,negative
"No, I don’t see it!",negative
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",negative
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",negative
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,negative
"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a",negative
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",negative
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",negative
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",negative

"Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!",negative
No! I mean come on! This is a,negative
You don't know anything.,negative
"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.",negative
"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",negative
"You know, this isn't fair.",negative
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,negative
Huh?,negative
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",negative
Okay wait!,negative
You listen to me!,negative

"Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!",negative
I’m next!,negative
It’s my turn!,negative
It’s only fair!,negative
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you!,negative
"Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you!",negative
And my husband  he’s a lawyer!,negative
Go get back on that case honey!,negative
"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",negative
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",negative
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative
Sit!,negative
That cup is mine!,negative

"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative

Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",negative

"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,negative
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,negative
"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative
Fine!,negative
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility!",negative
“...I can begin to trust you again.,negative
Does that seem like something you can do.,negative
Does it?!,negative
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",negative

"All right, I'm going. I'm going.",negative
WHAT IS IT?!,negative

"Oh, DAMN IT!",negative
"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",negative
"Well, up yours too!",negative
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",negative
Gimme them!,negative

You stole them from me!,negative
You stole them from me!!,negative
Gimme them!,negative
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",negative

You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler.,negative

Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!,negative
There’s just so much pressure.,negative
"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",negative
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",negative
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,negative
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,negative
What a wank!,negative
"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",negative
I know!,negative
"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",negative
And I’m appalled for you by the way.,negative
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",negative
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",negative
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",negative
Like me tiny doctor!’,negative
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",negative
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",negative
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",negative
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,negative
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,negative
Ow!!,negative
"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",negative
"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",negative
"Okay, good bye!",negative
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,negative

"Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",negative
"It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities.",negative
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,negative
There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!,negative
Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,negative
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,negative
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,negative
"So, I hear, you hate me!",negative
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,negative
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",negative
But what does that gonna do...,negative

"No, I don’t see it!",negative
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",negative
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",negative
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,negative
"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a",negative
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",negative

"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",negative
"You know, this isn't fair.",negative
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,negative
Huh?,negative
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",negative
Okay wait!,negative

And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you!,negative
"Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you!",negative
And my husband  he’s a lawyer!,negative
Go get back on that case honey!,negative
"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",negative
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",negative
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative

Not at these prices.,negative
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",negative
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",negative
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,negative
Really stupid.,negative
Yeah. No. No...,negative
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?,negative

You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,negative
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",negative

You stole them from me!,negative
You stole them from me!!,negative
Gimme them!,negative
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",negative
"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time!",negative
You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler.,negative

Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!,negative
There’s just so much pressure.,negative
"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",negative
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",negative
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,negative
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,negative
What a wank!,negative
"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",negative
I know!,negative
"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",negative
And I’m appalled for you by the way.,negative
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",negative
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",negative
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",negative
Like me tiny doctor!’,negative
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",negative
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",negative
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",negative
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,negative
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,negative
Ow!!,negative
"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",negative
"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",negative
"Okay, good bye!",negative
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,negative
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!,negative
"Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",negative
"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!",negative
"Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",negative
"It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities.",negative
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,negative
There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!,negative
Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,negative
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,negative
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,negative
"So, I hear, you hate me!",negative
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,negative
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",negative
But what does that gonna do...,negative
For Chandler!,negative
"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",negative
I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.,negative
It’s Joshua.,negative

"Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.",negative
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!,negative
Damnit!,negative
"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",negative
Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,negative
"No, I don’t see it!",negative
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",negative
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",negative
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,negative
"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a",negative
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",negative
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",negative

"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.",negative
"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",negative
"You know, this isn't fair.",negative
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,negative
Huh?,negative
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",negative
Okay wait!,negative
You listen to me!,negative
You listen to me!,negative
"Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!",negative
I’m next!,negative
It’s my turn!,negative
It’s only fair!,negative
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you!,negative
"Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you!",negative
And my husband  he’s a lawyer!,negative
Go get back on that case honey!,negative
"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",negative
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",negative
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative
Sit!,negative
That cup is mine!,negative
"No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!",negative
What?! You got us evicted!!,negative
I told you not to go down there!,negative
Rachel always cries!,negative
That’s not true!,negative
Go!!,negative
"Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’",negative
You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!,negative
What’s wrong with you?,negative
Nothing!,negative
No way!,negative
"‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!",negative
Damn you 15s!,negative
Shhhh!,negative
"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",negative
She is not…  She’s gay. Oh my God. She is,negative
Why should I help you?!,negative
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me!",negative
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",negative
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,negative
Who is being loud?,negative
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",negative
Pants and a sweater?,negative
"Why, mom?",negative
Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?,negative
Power company guys?,negative
Eligible looters?,negative
Could we talk about this later?,negative
You said she was bald.,negative
"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",negative
"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got",negative
"I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.",negative
"Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!",negative
Then don't break in!!,negative
"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",negative
"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",negative
Not at these prices.,negative
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",negative
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",negative
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,negative
Really stupid.,negative
Yeah. No. No...,negative
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?,negative
When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,negative
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,negative
He's a dropper!,negative
"Oh yeah, that's right!",negative
I'm not a dropper!,negative
It's throwing and catching!,negative
"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",negative
"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",negative
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",negative
"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.",negative
Maybe you should.,negative
Isn't!,negative
No. No-no. No. What would,negative
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,negative
"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",negative
Are you mocking me?,negative
Why not?!,negative
No!,negative
"All right, bye!",negative
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!,negative
I came with Paul!,negative
Get up!,negative
What the hell was that?!,negative
Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,negative
Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,negative
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",negative
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?,negative
I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!,negative
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,negative
I can't write!,negative
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",negative
"Yes, yes it is. It’s uh…  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!",negative
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.",negative
That bitch!,negative
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!,negative
"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!",negative
What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding?,negative
What could I have possibly done?!,negative
Stuart!,negative

You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!,negative
"Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?",negative
"Come on, wussies!",negative
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!,negative
Y’know she has a face Ross!,negative
"I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",negative
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,negative
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",negative
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,negative
"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",negative
": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",negative
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",negative
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",negative
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",negative
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!",negative
Is that too much to ask after six years?!,negative
I mean what?,negative
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!,negative
I mean do we not have as much fun?!,negative
Hey!,negative
I did not cry my eyes out!!,negative
"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",negative
DO YOU?,negative
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,negative
I can’t find garbage bags!,negative
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.",negative
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,negative
You completely stole my answer!,negative
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,negative
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,negative
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",negative
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,negative
The Hardy boys?,negative
"Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right?",negative
"I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?",negative
You can’t marry him!,negative
"Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",negative
I can and I will!,negative
Hey!,negative
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!,negative
People have got to finish their stories!,negative

Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!,negative
Yes I did! And I put a little,negative
"Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",negative
"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are",negative
"No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.",negative
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,negative
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",negative
"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?",negative
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",negative
Hey!!,negative
"Oh, you’re kidding me!",negative
There’s nothing sexual about this?,negative
What are you looking at?!,negative
To Put the Camera Away!!!,negative
"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.",negative
"No, the little girl creeps me out.",negative
Why would the baby creep me out?,negative
Why would the little girl creep you out?,negative
"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",negative
"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is",negative
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",negative
"I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!",negative
"So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!",negative
'Cause I-I got nothing!,negative
"All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.",negative
Later is not good enough.,negative
What the hell!,negative
This is broken!,negative
It-it is broken!,negative
"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",negative
"You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",negative
It was in my room all night!,negative
"And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did?",negative
Shh!,negative
We’re trying to think!,negative
"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",negative
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",negative
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",negative
We said seven!,negative
We said six!,negative
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",negative
"You, get out of my shop!",negative
He went out with my wife!,negative
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did",negative
That’s my wife!!! Get out!,negative
"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.",negative
I know!,negative
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",negative
"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?",negative
"I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do.",negative
"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",negative
"I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",negative
"If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",negative
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,negative
You idiot!!,negative
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",negative
"What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!",negative
Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",negative
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’,negative
"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,negative
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,negative
"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative
Fine!,negative
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility!",negative
“...I can begin to trust you again.,negative
Does that seem like something you can do.,negative
Does it?!,negative
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",negative
"All right, all right.",negative
"All right, I'm going. I'm going.",negative
WHAT IS IT?!,negative
Monkey into man?,negative

"You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!",negative
Now let it go!,negative
The joke sucks!,negative

Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,negative

You stole them from me!,negative
You stole them from me!!,negative
Gimme them!,negative
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative

"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative

Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative
Sit!,negative
That cup is mine!,negative

"Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’",negative
You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!,negative
What’s wrong with you?,negative
Nothing!,negative
No way!,negative
"‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!",negative
Damn you 15s!,negative

"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",negative
She is not…  She’s gay. Oh my God. She is,negative

"Yeah, but they didn't ask me!",negative
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",negative
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,negative
Who is being loud?,negative
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",negative
Pants and a sweater?,negative
"Why, mom?",negative
Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?,negative
Power company guys?,negative
Eligible looters?,negative
Could we talk about this later?,negative
You said she was bald.,negative
"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",negative
"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got",negative
"I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.",negative
"Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!",negative
Then don't break in!!,negative
"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",negative
"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",negative
Not at these prices.,negative
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",negative
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",negative
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,negative
Really stupid.,negative
Yeah. No. No...,negative
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?,negative
When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,negative
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,negative
He's a dropper!,negative
"Oh yeah, that's right!",negative
I'm not a dropper!,negative
It's throwing and catching!,negative
"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",negative
"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",negative
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",negative
"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.",negative
Maybe you should.,negative
Isn't!,negative
No. No-no. No. What would,negative
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,negative
"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",negative
Are you mocking me?,negative
Why not?!,negative
No!,negative
"All right, bye!",negative
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!,negative
I came with Paul!,negative
Get up!,negative
What the hell was that?!,negative
Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,negative
Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,negative
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",negative
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?,negative
I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!,negative
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,negative
I can't write!,negative
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",negative
"Yes, yes it is. It’s uh…  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!",negative
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.",negative
That bitch!,negative
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!,negative
"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!",negative
What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding?,negative
What could I have possibly done?!,negative
Stuart!,negative
"Yeah, get out!",negative
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!,negative
"Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?",negative
"Come on, wussies!",negative
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!,negative
Y’know she has a face Ross!,negative
"I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",negative
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,negative
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",negative
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,negative
"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",negative
": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",negative
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",negative
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",negative
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",negative
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!",negative
Is that too much to ask after six years?!,negative
I mean what?,negative
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!,negative
I mean do we not have as much fun?!,negative
Hey!,negative
I did not cry my eyes out!!,negative
"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",negative
DO YOU?,negative
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,negative
I can’t find garbage bags!,negative
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.",negative
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,negative
You completely stole my answer!,negative
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,negative
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,negative
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",negative
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,negative
The Hardy boys?,negative
"Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right?",negative
"I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?",negative
You can’t marry him!,negative
"Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",negative
I can and I will!,negative
Hey!,negative
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!,negative
People have got to finish their stories!,negative
No!,negative
They are completely different—Okay!,negative
Yeah! Got it!,negative
Tag!,negative
I’m serious!,negative
This isn’t funny!,negative
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!,negative
Yes I did! And I put a little,negative
"Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",negative
"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are",negative
"No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.",negative
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,negative
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",negative
"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?",negative
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",negative
Hey!!,negative
"Oh, you’re kidding me!",negative
There’s nothing sexual about this?,negative
What are you looking at?!,negative
To Put the Camera Away!!!,negative
"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.",negative
"No, the little girl creeps me out.",negative
Why would the baby creep me out?,negative
Why would the little girl creep you out?,negative
"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",negative
"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is",negative
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",negative
"I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!",negative
"So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!",negative
'Cause I-I got nothing!,negative
"All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.",negative
Later is not good enough.,negative
What the hell!,negative
This is broken!,negative
It-it is broken!,negative
"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",negative
"You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",negative
It was in my room all night!,negative
"And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did?",negative
Shh!,negative
We’re trying to think!,negative
"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",negative
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",negative
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",negative
We said seven!,negative
We said six!,negative
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",negative
"You, get out of my shop!",negative
He went out with my wife!,negative
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did",negative
That’s my wife!!! Get out!,negative
"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.",negative
I know!,negative
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",negative
"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?",negative
"I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do.",negative
"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",negative
"I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",negative
"If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",negative
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,negative
You idiot!!,negative
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",negative
"What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!",negative
Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",negative
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’,negative
"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,negative
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,negative
"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative
Fine!,negative
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility!",negative
“...I can begin to trust you again.,negative
Does that seem like something you can do.,negative
Does it?!,negative
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",negative
"All right, all right.",negative
"All right, I'm going. I'm going.",negative
WHAT IS IT?!,negative
Monkey into man?,negative
I’m Doctor Monkey!,negative
"You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!",negative
Now let it go!,negative
The joke sucks!,negative
Is not.,negative
"Did you, did you",negative
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,negative
Then don't touch one!!,negative
Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again!,negative
Hang on buddy!,negative
"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!",negative
"Oh, DAMN IT!",negative
"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",negative
"Well, up yours too!",negative
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",negative
Gimme them!,negative
No! They are mine!,negative
You stole them from me!,negative
You stole them from me!!,negative
Gimme them!,negative
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",negative
"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time!",negative
You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler.,negative
Joey! He’s working!  You would look,negative
Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!,negative
There’s just so much pressure.,negative
"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",negative
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",negative
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,negative
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,negative
What a wank!,negative
"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",negative
I know!,negative
"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",negative
And I’m appalled for you by the way.,negative
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",negative
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",negative
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",negative
Like me tiny doctor!’,negative
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",negative
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",negative
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",negative
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,negative
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,negative
Ow!!,negative
"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",negative
"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",negative
"Okay, good bye!",negative
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,negative
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!,negative
"Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",negative
"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!",negative
"Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",negative
"It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities.",negative
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,negative
There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!,negative
Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,negative
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,negative
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,negative
"So, I hear, you hate me!",negative
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,negative
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",negative
But what does that gonna do...,negative
For Chandler!,negative
"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",negative
I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.,negative
It’s Joshua.,negative
Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go!  Come on!  Why aren’t you dressed yet?!,negative
"Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.",negative
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!,negative
Damnit!,negative
"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",negative
Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,negative
"No, I don’t see it!",negative
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",negative
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",negative
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,negative
"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a",negative
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",negative
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",negative
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",negative
Yeah!,negative
It’s Clint. It’s Clint!,negative

Come on Joey!!!,negative
"Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!",negative
No! I mean come on! This is a,negative
You don't know anything.,negative
"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.",negative
"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",negative
"You know, this isn't fair.",negative
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,negative
Huh?,negative
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",negative
Okay wait!,negative
You listen to me!,negative
You listen to me!,negative
"Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!",negative
I’m next!,negative
It’s my turn!,negative
It’s only fair!,negative
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you!,negative
"Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you!",negative
And my husband  he’s a lawyer!,negative
Go get back on that case honey!,negative
"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",negative
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",negative
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative
Sit!,negative
That cup is mine!,negative

The Hardy boys?,negative

"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are",negative
"No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.",negative
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,negative
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",negative
"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?",negative
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",negative

"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",negative
"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is",negative
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",negative
"I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!",negative
"So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!",negative
'Cause I-I got nothing!,negative
"All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.",negative
Later is not good enough.,negative

Shh!,negative
We’re trying to think!,negative
"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",negative
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",negative
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",negative
We said seven!,negative
We said six!,negative
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",negative
"You, get out of my shop!",negative
He went out with my wife!,negative
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did",negative
That’s my wife!!! Get out!,negative
"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.",negative

"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",negative
"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?",negative

"If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",negative
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,negative
You idiot!!,negative
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",negative
"What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!",negative
Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",negative
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’,negative
"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,negative
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,negative
"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative
Fine!,negative
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility!",negative
“...I can begin to trust you again.,negative
Does that seem like something you can do.,negative
Does it?!,negative
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",negative
"All right, all right.",negative
"All right, I'm going. I'm going.",negative
WHAT IS IT?!,negative
Monkey into man?,negative

"You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!",negative
Now let it go!,negative
The joke sucks!,negative
Is not.,negative
"Did you, did you",negative
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,negative
Then don't touch one!!,negative

Hang on buddy!,negative
"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!",negative
"Oh, DAMN IT!",negative
"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",negative
"Well, up yours too!",negative
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",negative
Gimme them!,negative
No! They are mine!,negative
You stole them from me!,negative
You stole them from me!!,negative
Gimme them!,negative
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",negative
"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time!",negative
You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler.,negative
Joey! He’s working!  You would look,negative
Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!,negative
There’s just so much pressure.,negative
"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",negative
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",negative
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,negative
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,negative
What a wank!,negative
"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",negative
I know!,negative
"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",negative
And I’m appalled for you by the way.,negative
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",negative
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",negative
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",negative
Like me tiny doctor!’,negative
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",negative
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",negative
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",negative
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,negative
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,negative
Ow!!,negative
"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",negative
"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",negative
"Okay, good bye!",negative
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,negative
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!,negative
"Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",negative
"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!",negative
"Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",negative
"It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities.",negative
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,negative
There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!,negative
Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,negative
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,negative
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,negative
"So, I hear, you hate me!",negative
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,negative
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",negative
But what does that gonna do...,negative
For Chandler!,negative
"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",negative

"Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.",negative
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!,negative
Damnit!,negative
"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",negative
Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,negative
"No, I don’t see it!",negative
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",negative
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",negative
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,negative
"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a",negative
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",negative
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",negative

"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.",negative
"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",negative
"You know, this isn't fair.",negative
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,negative
Huh?,negative
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",negative
Okay wait!,negative
You listen to me!,negative

It’s only fair!,negative
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you!,negative
"Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you!",negative
And my husband  he’s a lawyer!,negative
Go get back on that case honey!,negative
"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",negative
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",negative
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative
Sit!,negative

"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",negative
She is not…  She’s gay. Oh my God. She is,negative
Why should I help you?!,negative
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me!",negative
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",negative
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,negative
Who is being loud?,negative
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",negative
Pants and a sweater?,negative
"Why, mom?",negative

Power company guys?,negative
Eligible looters?,negative

"Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!",negative
Then don't break in!!,negative
"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",negative
"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",negative
Not at these prices.,negative
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",negative
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",negative
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,negative
Really stupid.,negative
Yeah. No. No...,negative
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?,negative
When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,negative
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,negative
He's a dropper!,negative

Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,negative
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",negative
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?,negative
I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!,negative
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,negative
I can't write!,negative
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",negative
"Yes, yes it is. It’s uh…  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!",negative
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.",negative
That bitch!,negative

"Come on, wussies!",negative
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!,negative
Y’know she has a face Ross!,negative
"I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",negative
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,negative
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",negative
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,negative

": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",negative
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",negative
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",negative
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",negative
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!",negative
Is that too much to ask after six years?!,negative
I mean what?,negative

I can’t find garbage bags!,negative
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.",negative
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,negative
You completely stole my answer!,negative
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,negative

The Hardy boys?,negative
"Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right?",negative
"I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?",negative
You can’t marry him!,negative
"Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",negative

"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",negative
"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",negative
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",negative
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",negative
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!",negative
Straight up over your head!,negative
"Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.",negative

"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",negative
"I mean, enough of the silliness!",negative
"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",negative
Okay-okay!,negative
"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",negative
Define me!,negative
"Love me, I need love!",negative
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,negative
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,negative
What a wank!,negative
"Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.",negative
I know!,negative
"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",negative
And I’m appalled for you by the way.,negative
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",negative
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",negative
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",negative
Like me tiny doctor!’,negative
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",negative
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",negative
"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",negative
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,negative
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,negative
Ow!!,negative
"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",negative
"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.",negative

"Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",negative
"It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities.",negative
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!,negative
There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!,negative
Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!,negative
Oh what do you know? Virgin!,negative
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,negative
"So, I hear, you hate me!",negative
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,negative
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.",negative
But what does that gonna do...,negative

"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",negative
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",negative
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,negative
"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a",negative

"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?",negative
"You know, this isn't fair.",negative
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?,negative
Huh?,negative
"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?",negative
Okay wait!,negative
You listen to me!,negative

It’s only fair!,negative
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you!,negative
"Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you!",negative
And my husband  he’s a lawyer!,negative
Go get back on that case honey!,negative
"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",negative
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",negative
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for,negative

Then don't break in!!,negative
"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",negative
"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",negative
Not at these prices.,negative
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",negative
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",negative
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,negative
Really stupid.,negative
Yeah. No. No...,negative
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?,negative
When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,negative
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,negative
He's a dropper!,negative

Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,negative
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",negative

"Come on, wussies!",negative
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!,negative
Y’know she has a face Ross!,negative

You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,negative
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",negative
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,negative

": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",negative
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",negative
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",negative
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",negative
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!",negative
Is that too much to ask after six years?!,negative
I mean what?,negative

I can’t find garbage bags!,negative
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.",negative
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,negative
You completely stole my answer!,negative
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,negative
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,negative
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",negative
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,negative
The Hardy boys?,negative
"Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right?",negative
"I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?",negative
You can’t marry him!,negative
"Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",negative

Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,negative
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",negative
"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?",negative
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",negative
Hey!!,negative
"Oh, you’re kidding me!",negative

To Put the Camera Away!!!,negative
"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.",negative
"No, the little girl creeps me out.",negative
Why would the baby creep me out?,negative
Why would the little girl creep you out?,negative
"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",negative
"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is",negative
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",negative
"I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!",negative
"So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!",negative
'Cause I-I got nothing!,negative
"All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.",negative
Later is not good enough.,negative
What the hell!,negative

It-it is broken!,negative
"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",negative
"You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",negative

"And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did?",negative
Shh!,negative
We’re trying to think!,negative
"Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",negative
"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",negative
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.,negative
This woman's living my life.,negative
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",negative
"Look at this, look.",negative
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,negative
"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",negative
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,negative
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",negative
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",negative
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",negative
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",negative
We said seven!,negative
We said six!,negative
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",negative
"You, get out of my shop!",negative
He went out with my wife!,negative
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did",negative
That’s my wife!!! Get out!,negative
"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.",negative
I know!,negative
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",negative
"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?",negative
"I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do.",negative
"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",negative
"I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",negative
"If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",negative
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,negative
You idiot!!,negative
"You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!",negative
"What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!",negative
Huh?,negative
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",negative
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",negative
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’,negative
"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",negative
Oh yes there is!,negative
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,negative
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.,negative
"Oh God, do something.",negative
"Just make contact, smile!",negative
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.",negative
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,negative
"Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.",negative
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",negative
I shared my puddin’ which you man!,negative
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,",negative
Fine!,negative
Fine!,negative
"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility!",negative
“...I can begin to trust you again.,negative
Does that seem like something you can do.,negative
Does it?!,negative
"Joey, get out of the fridge.",negative

"All right, I'm going. I'm going.",negative
WHAT IS IT?!,negative
